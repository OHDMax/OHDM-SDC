# OHDM Scientific Data Collector

This is a small set of proof-of-concept applications to show that the OHDM databases is able to hold data of any kind.
It was created by Patrick Fehling (Web App), Ã–mar Yilmaz (Android App) and Maximilian Schulze (PHP API)  
  
The PHP API was created as bridge between the Android/Web Application and the actual API of OHDM. In the future this bridge may not be necessary as OHDM and it's API constantly evolve.
